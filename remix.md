# IDE

## Remix

Remix is a browser based IDE reachable here: [https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/)

UX is a bit odd. In the second tab \(paper plane\) you can set your origin address. If you're using the JS-VM then you have to copy theses addresses from the HTML source code if you want to use them in the form below.

One thing which really bite us was that you have to use addresses in the input fields with quotes. So always enter addresses like that: "0x14723a09acff6d2a60dcdf7aa4aff308fddc160c"
