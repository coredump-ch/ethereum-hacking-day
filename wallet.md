## Choosing a Wallet

We tried two GUI clients:

* [Ethereum Wallet](https://ethereum-wallet.net/)
* [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist)

Both are HTML based \(Electron?\) applications, which apparently use a similar code base which also seems to be similarly buggy.

Mist includes the [Remix-IDE](https://github.com/ethereum/remix) and automatically links the testnet to your test contracts for debugging them.
